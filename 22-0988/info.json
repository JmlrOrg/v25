    "abstract": "We introduce two new classes of measures of information for statistical experiments which generalise and subsume \u03c6-divergences, integral probability metrics, N-distances (MMD), and (f,\u0393) divergences between two or more distributions. This enables us to derive a simple geometrical relationship between measures of information and the Bayes risk of a statistical decision problem, thus extending the variational \u03c6-divergence representation to multiple distributions in an entirely symmetric manner. The new families of divergence are closed under the action of Markov operators which yields an information processing equality which is a refinement and generalisation of the classical information processing inequality. This equality gives insight into the significance of the choice of the hypothesis class in classical risk minimization.",

    "title": "Dropout Regularization Versus l2-Penalization in the Linear Model",
    "abstract": "We investigate the statistical behavior of gradient descent iterates with dropout in the linear regression model. In particular, non-asymptotic bounds for the convergence of expectations and covariance matrices of the iterates are derived. The results shed more light on the widely cited connection between dropout and $\\ell_2$-regularization in the linear model. We indicate a more subtle relationship, owing to interactions between the gradient descent dynamics and the additional randomness induced by dropout. Further, we study a simplified variant of dropout which does not have a regularizing effect and converges to the least squares estimator.",

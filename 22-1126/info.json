    "abstract": "We study the problem of finding a near-stationary point for smooth minimax optimization. The recently proposed extra anchored gradient (EAG) methods achieve the optimal convergence rate for the convex-concave minimax problem in the deterministic setting.  However, the direct extension of EAG to stochastic optimization is not efficient. In this paper, we design a novel stochastic algorithm called Recursive Anchored IteratioN (RAIN).  We show that the RAIN achieves near-optimal stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity for stochastic minimax optimization in both convex-concave and strongly-convex-strongly-concave cases. In addition, we extend the idea of RAIN to solve structured nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problem and it also achieves near-optimal SFO complexity.",

    "abstract": "QDax is an open-source library with a streamlined and modular API for Quality-Diversity (QD) optimisation algorithms in Jax. The library serves as a versatile tool for optimisation purposes, ranging from black-box optimisation to continuous control. QDax offers implementations of popular QD, Neuroevolution, and Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, supported by various examples. All the implementations can be just-in-time compiled with Jax, facilitating efficient execution across multiple accelerators, including GPUs and TPUs. These implementations effectively demonstrate the framework's flexibility and user-friendliness, easing experimentation for research purposes. Furthermore, the library is thoroughly documented and has 93% test coverage.",
